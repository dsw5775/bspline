This is a B-Spline implementation in my project by using OpenMP and CUDA.

It covers 1-dimensional to 5-dimensional data.
You can calculate the fitting value, first- and second-derivative for 1-dimensional data.
For higher-dimensional data, only fitting value and first-derivative are covered due to my own need. But it can be easily extended by following the code.
